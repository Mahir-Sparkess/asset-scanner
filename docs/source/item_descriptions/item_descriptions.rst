These documents describe how to process the files within a dataset and extract facets.
These documents are aggregated along the branch with the information lower in the tree taking
precendence.
Having multiple files at different points in the tree allow for a narrowing of information.
i.e. A default set at a higher level, if not overwritten, will exist at all points down the tree.

Example Description File
========================

This file applies to all files listed under: ``/badc/faam/data``.

It uses the regex processor in two forms. The first, uses a pre-processor
to reduce the filepath to just the filename and then matches a regex pattern to
extract a date. This is then passed to the ISO Date post-processor which converts
the date into the ISO8601 format.

The second, extracts platform and flight number from the filepath.
No pre or post processing is done in this case.

Finally the platform and flight number are used to generate a string which will
identify all files in this dataset as belonging together.

.. code-block:: yaml

    paths:
      - /badc/faam/data
    facets:
      extraction_methods:
        - name: regex
          inputs:

          pre_processors:
            - name: filename_reducer
          post_processors:
            - name: isodate_processor
              inputs:
                date_key: datetime
        - name: regex
          inputs:
            regex: '^\/(?:[^/]*/)(?P<platform>\w*)\/(?:[^/]*/){2}(?P<flight_number>\w\d{3})'
      aggregation_facets:
        - platform
